<title>Resident Evil</title>
<h1>Chapter 4</h1>
<h3>We're Going to China</h3>
<p>
	When Leon and Helena finally arrive in China, they find panic in the streets as a bioterror attack is in full-swing.
</p>
<p>
	Amidst the chaos, however, Leon is reunited with fellow Raccoon City Incident-survivor Sherry Birkin. Now a federal agent, her current assignment is to protect Jake, the young man with her. It turns out, however, that Sherry's superior is none other than Simmons.
</p>
<p>
	Taken aback by Simmons' actions, Sherry reveals his location to Leon. Despite being separated in the ensuing fight, Leon promises to meet up with her again at Simmons' location.
</p>
<p>
	On their way there, Leon and Helena catch sight of Ada, and attempt to get information out of her. However, at that very moment Chris of the BSAA shows up and, in a rage, accuses Ada of being the mastermind behind the attacks. Leon interjects, insisting that the real culprit is Simmons; as their argument reaches a boiling point guns are drawn, giving Ada an opportunity to escape. Leaving her capture to Chris and company, Leon and Helena head after Simmons.
</p>
<p>
	The two agents arrive to face off with Simmons just ahead of Sherry and Jake. Determined to settle this very personal vendetta themselves, Leon and Helena make cover for the younger pair to escape, then proceed to attack.
</p>
<p>
	However, Simmons is injected with the C-Virus, endowing him with unspeakably powerful mutative abilities; a fierce battle ensues, with Leon and Helena narrowly putting an end to him.
</p>
<p>
	Simmons is defeated, and retribution for the deaths of President Benford, Deborah and countless others is had.
