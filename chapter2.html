<title>Resident Evil</title>
<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<h3>The Cathedral</h3>
<p>
   After fighting through hordes of the infected, Leon and Helena somehow manage to reach the cathedral. Below the hallowed grounds is a strange lab, dotted with cocoon-like entities that seem to have mutated from humans. Here, Leon views a mysterious tape of the spy Ada Wong being birthed from a cocoon.
</p>
<p>
	However, the "truth" of which Helena had spoke is buried even further in the depths: in the deepest recesses of the catacombs is Deborah, Helena's sister. What should have been a joyful reunion, however, is cut short in mere moments as Deborah suddenly begins to burn and writhe in agony.
</p>
<p>
	She transforms into a cocoon like the ones seen in the lab. However, this is followed by a second transformation, as Deborah emerges from the chrysalid, no longer herself, but as a monstrous B.O.W. that proceeds to attack Leon and Helena. As the ensuing battle grows more dire, Ada suddenly comes to the two agents' rescue. Her appearance gives Leon pause as he recalls what he had seen in the lab, sparking feelings of distrust.
</p>
<p>
	The fight, however, is ended by Helena. Choking back bitter tears, she is forced to kill her sister, the very person she had come to rescue. With her sister lost forever, Helena finally reveals the truth of what happened in Tall Oaks.
</p>
<p>
	The person behind it all was a single man: Derek Simmons, a presidential aide. Helena goes on to explain that her sister Deborah had been taken hostage by Simmons, forcing Helena to assist in his plan to assassinate the president. With this, Ada takes her leave, and the two agents attempt to contact federal agent Hunnigan; however, it is Simmons who answers their call.
