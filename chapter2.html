<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<h3>The Cathedral</h3>
<p>
   After fighting through hordes of the infected, Leon and Helena somehow manage to reach the cathedral. Below the hallowed grounds is a strange lab, dotted with cocoon-like entities that seem to have mutated from humans. Here, Leon views a mysterious tape of the spy Ada Wong being birthed from a cocoon.
</p>
<p>
	However, the "truth" of which Helena had spoke is buried even further in the depths: in the deepest recesses of the catacombs is Deborah, Helena's sister. What should have been a joyful reunion, however, is cut short in mere moments as Deborah suddenly begins to burn and writhe in agony.
</p>
<p>
	She transforms into a cocoon like the ones seen in the lab. However, this is followed by a second transformation, as Deborah emerges from the chrysalid, no longer herself, but as a monstrous B.O.W. that proceeds to attack Leon and Helena. As the ensuing battle grows more dire, Ada suddenly comes to the two agents' rescue. Her appearance gives Leon pause as he recalls what he had seen in the lab, sparking feelings of distrust.
