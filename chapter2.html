<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<h3>The Cathedral</h3>
<p>
   After fighting through hordes of the infected, Leon and Helena somehow manage to reach the cathedral. Below the hallowed grounds is a strange lab, dotted with cocoon-like entities that seem to have mutated from humans. Here, Leon views a mysterious tape of the spy Ada Wong being birthed from a cocoon.
