<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<h3>The Catacombs</h3>
<p>
   Derek Simmons was the man who orchestrated the attack in Tall Oaks, which lead to the assassination of the president. As part of his plan, Simmons frames Leon and Helena for the crime, taunting them with the promise to clear their names if they come to him. Having been used by Simmons, and ultimately losing her sister to his treachery, Helena is pushed to the brink.
</p>
<p>
	With the two agents now sharing a common enemy, they vow to bring Simmons to justice, and begin to make their way out of the catacombs. However, upon arriving at the surface, Leon and Helena bear witness to yet another tragedy: in what must be an attempt to contain the outbreak, Tall Oaks is eradicated by missile strike. Suffering the same fate as Raccoon City, the once picturesque city is wiped off the map.
